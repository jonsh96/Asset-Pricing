## 3. Testing the Liquidity Factor for the Cross-Section of Stock Returns 

Download monthly portfolios for US stocks sorted by size and momentum (download data from 
http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/25_Portfolios_ME_Prior_12_2_CSV.zip). Now use Liquidity factor as in Pastor and Stambaugh (2003, Journal of Political Economy).
(The data is here http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/lubos.pastor/research/liq_data_1962_2013.txt). 

Perform the exercises a) and b) using only the in-sample period from the beginning of the sample until August 2008 (just before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers).

a) Perform the test of the CAPM by running a two-steps Fama-MacBeth regression.  Fully interpret the result and comment upon the validity of the model and its ability to explain the cross-section of the 
portfolio returns.

b) Add the additional factors' betas and test the extended model. Fully interpret the results and comment upon the validity of the model and its ability to explain the cross-section of the portfolio returns. How 
do the results differ from the previous ones? Provide economic justficiation of the difference between performances of the models.

c) Re-estimate the model out-of-sample (using the period from September 2008 until the most recent observation). Compare the performances of the models (both the CAPM and the extended factor model) in both
samples. Comment upon the obtained results.
